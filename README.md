Towers of Hanoi

On the first day of CMSC 401 (Algorithms With Advanced Data Structures), we had a pop quiz and I realized I still couldn't solve this. So I made this during snowpocalypse 2016. I used some simple HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery.

To run this, just clone or download the repository and open index.html.

This app also demonstrates how fast computers are. When I auto-solve 16 disks (>65,000) steps, it completes in about 4.5 seconds on Chrome and about 6.5 seconds on Firefox.
